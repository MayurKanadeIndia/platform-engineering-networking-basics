# 🌐 Networking Basics: Unicast, Multicast & Broadcast

#### Let’s learn how computers talk to each other on a network using three simple methods.

#### Think of computers like kids sending messages to each other. 💌

### 🧠 What Is Networking?

- Networking means computers sharing information with each other.
- They send messages called data 📦 through wires or Wi-Fi 📡.

Just like people talk in different ways:

- Talking to one person
- Talking to a group
- Shouting to everyone

Computers do the same! 😄

#### 🛠 How It Works (Step by Step)

### 2️⃣ Multicast – Talking to a Group of Friends 👦➡️👦👦👦

#### 📌 What is Multicast?
