# 🧠 What is a MAC Address?

A MAC Address is a unique ID number given to every device that can connect to a network (like a computer, laptop, or mobile).

Think of it like:

- 🧍 Your name tag
- 🚗 A car number plate
- 💻 A device identity card

MAC means Media Access Control.

### 🔢 What Does a MAC Address Look Like?

##### Example:

##### 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

##### It has 12 characters

- Uses numbers (0–9) and letters (A–F)
- Every device has its own unique MAC address

---

### 💳 Who Gives the MAC Address?

- The MAC address is given by the LAN Card (Network Card) inside your device.
- The MAC address is added in the factory.
- It is stored inside the hardware.
- That is why it is also called Physical Address.

### 🏭 Who Manages MAC Addresses in the World?

#### The global organization responsible is:

### IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

#### IEEE:

- Controls MAC address rules
- Gives MAC address ranges to companies
- Makes sure MAC addresses are unique worldwide
- Companies like Intel, Apple, Dell, and Samsung get MAC numbers from IEEE.

#### 🧩 MAC Address Structure

- AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
- AA:BB:CC → Company ID (given by IEEE)
- DD:EE:FF → Device number

#### 🧑‍💻 How to Find MAC Address in Windows

- Press Windows + R
- Type cmd and press Enter
- Type: ipconfig /all
- Find Physical Address
- That Physical Address is the MAC Address.

#### 🌐 Why MAC Address is Important?

- Identifies devices in a network
- Helps data reach the correct device
- Used inside LAN (Local Area Network)
- Helps with basic network security

#### 🆚 MAC Address vs IP Address

#### MAC Address:

- Fixed
- Hardware based
- Given by factory
- Works inside LAN

#### IP Address:

- Can change
- Software based
- Given by network
- Works on the Internet

#### 📘 Quick Summary

- MAC Address is the identity of a network device
- Provided by the LAN card
- Managed globally by IEEE
- Found using ipconfig /all
- Unique for every device
